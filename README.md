# Cloud Governance Portfolio

This repository represents applied Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) engineering work across Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The projects demonstrate structured cloud governance implementation focused on identity governance, access scope management, least privilege enforcement, control validation, and architectural alignment.

The repository is organized by cloud platform and governance domain to reflect a real-world cloud governance program structure.

## Governance Domains Represented

### 1. Identity Governance
- IAM hardening
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) strategy
- Scope and inheritance analysis
- Group-based access control implementation
- Least privilege enforcement

### 2. Information Protection
- Data classification governance
- Access visibility considerations
- Labeling and control awareness practices

### 3. Cloud Governance Architecture
- Subscription and resource boundary design
- Control hierarchy evaluation
- Governance-driven cloud structuring

---

## Azure Governance Implementations

Azure projects demonstrate:

- Subscription vs resource-level RBAC evaluation  
- Remediation of over-scoped role assignments  
- IAM permission hardening  
- Governance-aligned cloud architecture design  
- Data classification control implementation  

---

## AWS Governance Implementations

AWS projects demonstrate:

- IAM policy evaluation and refinement  
- Over-privileged access remediation  
- Identity boundary enforcement  
- Governance-focused access structuring  

---

## Governance Engineering Methodology

Each project follows a structured approach:

1. Identify Risk or Governance Gap  
2. Evaluate Existing Control Scope  
3. Implement Remediation or Control Improvement  
4. Validate Reduced Risk & Enforcement Accuracy  
5. Document and Align to Governance Principles  

---

## Framework Awareness

Projects are conceptually aligned with governance and security standards including:

- NIST Access Control & Risk Management principles  
- CIS Benchmarks  
- Zero Trust Architecture concepts  
- General audit-readiness best practices  

---

## Portfolio Intent

This repository serves as a structured, continuously evolving body of work demonstrating applied cloud governance engineering across multi-cloud environments.

Additional governance domains and risk-focused artifacts will be incorporated as implementations expand.
